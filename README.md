Healthcare Claims ML Explainability
Overview
This project focuses on applying machine learning to analyze healthcare claims data while ensuring model transparency using SHAP and LIME. The goal is to predict high-cost patients, detect potential fraud, and improve decision-making in healthcare billing and claims processing.

Key Features
Predictive Analytics: Identifies high-cost patients and claims likely to be denied.
Anomaly Detection: Detects fraudulent claims using unsupervised learning.
Explainable AI: Uses SHAP and LIME to interpret model decisions.
Big Data Processing: Leverages Apache Spark for large-scale claims data processing.
SQL-Driven Insights: Analyzes billing trends, claim patterns, and provider performance.
Real-Time API: Deploys models via Flask for integration with healthcare systems.
Technology Stack
Python (Pandas, Scikit-Learn, SHAP, LIME)
SQL (PostgreSQL for claims analysis)
Apache Spark (Big data processing)
Flask (API for real-time predictions)
Jupyter Notebook (Exploratory data analysis and visualization)
Project Workflow
Data Collection: Extracts claims data from structured and unstructured sources.
Data Preprocessing: Cleans, transforms, and standardizes data.
Feature Engineering: Creates meaningful variables for predictive modeling.
Model Training: Develops ML models for cost prediction and fraud detection.
Model Explainability: Uses SHAP and LIME to interpret model predictions.
Evaluation & Deployment: Tests model accuracy and deploys as an API for integration.
Use Cases
Insurance companies predicting claim denials.
Healthcare providers optimizing reimbursement processes.
Fraud analysts detecting suspicious claims.
